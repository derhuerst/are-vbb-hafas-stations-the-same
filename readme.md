# are-vbb-hafas-stations-the-same

**Check if two stations from the VBB API should be one.** It compares if both stations have the same scheduled departures. Work in progress.

The heuristic doesn't work yet with edge cases, such as distinct bus stations that the VBB API reports the same departures for. Known pairs:

- [*Am Fischtal* (`900000050258`) and *Im Gestell* (`900000050259`)](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/52.44704/13.25758&layers=T)
